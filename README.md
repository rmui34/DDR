This project is a FPGA version of Dance Dance Revolution.

Description:
This game has no time limit and is fun for all ages! Everyone is a winner! The game begins on row 8 where lights will begin scrolling up.  It is played on Row 8 to Row 1 and from Column 3 to Column 6. Row 2 is the “Goal Light” and as the lights move up the bank click the corresponding key to score points. If the key is clicked at the right time, you will get 2 points. If you miss but get the light in row 1 you get 1 point. Pressing the keys at any other time will result in losing 2 points. If the default speed is too slow for you try the “Pro- Mode” by flipping SW0 on. To reset the game use SW9. Have fun !
